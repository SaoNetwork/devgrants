# Project Description

SAO, an abbr. for Storage Aggregated/Autonomous Organization, is a decentralized storage network that utilizes the distributed peer-to-peer networks (e.g. Filecoin, Ethereum, Polygon) to create a framework for data to be managed by a Storage DAO . It provides an effective mechanism for the data to be verified, stored and readily available for any service or Web3 application.

In phase one, SAO network will run the Filecoin miner nodes to help to store the useful data and make earnings from the storage mining business. We will make the miner nodes run publicly, transparently and governed by a DAO. The proceeds of mining business will be distributed with a set of rules encoded on Ethereum, or Filecoin in the future (if Filecoin network supports smart contracts someday).

SAO network is designed to give NFT creators and NFT markets a single, effective, customizable, integrated productivity tool for storing useful data on their own for a certain period as expected or even permanently on a decentralized storage network like Filecoin, rather than on a central server; and it takes full advantage of the IPFS system, the oracle solutions and the latest AI recognition technologies to protect and track the copyright on any piece of painting, writing, music, etc. It will be a tool and community platform that users can trust, control, and extend to their liking. We want to do away with the terrible user experience of the current centralized apps and the data service.

In the next step after fundraising, SAO will provide an easy-to-use store pattern of any data that is useful or meaningful for our users on Filecoin Network, including files, pictures, videos, music, digital artworks, and data backup, etc. SDS integrates the smart contract based on multiple blockchains with oracle technology. Also SAO will provide a powerful search engine for useful data stored in SAO, like NFTs, historical documents, Meteorological data, online libraries, etc.

 The Web 3 era is coming. And also we believe the SAO network has an enormous collaborative potential that the future Metaverse world needs.

## Value


The SAO network will become one of the most easy-to-use tools in the Filecoin ecosystem.

It will provide users with an easy way to upload and store files on to the distributed peer-to-peer networks, release a feature of store-to-earn to reward the data providers, enable users to mint NFTs with metadata of their stored files, provide Web3 applications with some publicly available data they need, create a standard accounting system for data billing and pricing to benefit the data providers.

Besides, the Filecoin mining DAO will also engage more people to take part in the Filecoin storage mining. At the beginning, we will provide the hardware and software solution for free and the only thing that users need to do is to stake Filecoin in the nodes.

## Deliverables

- Launch a publicly, transparently, and jointly FIL-mining DApp governed by a DAO.
- Launch a easy-to-use store pattern of any data that is useful or meaningful for our users on Filecoin Network.
- Launch a search engine/navigation.
- Initiate a Data DAO for Web 3 and Metaverse world using the blockchain technologies, oracle solutions, token economy model, and AI recognition technologies, etc.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 Jointly FIL-mining DApp

  - SAO Network is set to upgrade the concept of cloud mining to “joint mining”. With a strong technical know-how in the development and operations of Filecoin storage mining, the core team of SAO Network has developed a “Joint Mining” product. It allows users to join the mining business to earn FIL (a cryptocurrency that powers the Filecoin network) by staking FIL and obtaining a certain amount of storage power shares. We call it “stake-to-earn”.

  ### Milestone 2 SAO Data Store

  - Provide users with an easy way to upload and store files on to the distributed peer-to-peer networks.

    Demo: http://54.250.148.229/sao-data-store/fileDemo

    AppId : sao_data_store_demo_app_id

    AppKey : sao_data_store_demo_app_key

  - Release a feature of store-to-earn to reward the data providers.

  - Enable users to mint NFTs with metadata of their stored files.

  - Provide Web3 applications with some publicly available data they need.

  - Create a standard accounting system for data billing and pricing to benefit the data providers.

  ### Milestone 3 Search Engine

  - SAO Network is to provide a powerful search engine for useful data like NFTs, historical documents, Meteorological data, online libraries, etc., which comes from the publicly available data of “Sao data store” and public files and research documents.

  ### Milestone 4 Storage DAO

  - The Storage DAO of SAO Network will be a completely decentralized storage autonomous organization that governs SAO Network. It will consist of core team, data providers, validators, mining shareholders, community members and other stakeholders that contribute to the security and stability of SAO Network. The Storage DAO will operate in a truly democratically autonomous way to determine how the Network functions and how prospective incentives are distributed, so as to serve the interests of every single user and stakeholder.

# Additional Information

The team consists of 4 full-time people and several part-timers who all have rich experience in Blockchain and IPFS and are keenly interested in this project. All the team members would like to be a part as well as make contributions to this project at the very beginning. After fundraising, we are planning to form an official team, and to hire more developers from the Filecoin developer community and business managers to reach out for more storage clients.
